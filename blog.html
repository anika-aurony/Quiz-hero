    <h1 >Question Answer</h1>
    <h3>1. What is the diffences between map, filter, foreach and find? </h3>
    <p >
        map() executes the same code on all the element of an array and returns a new array with the updated elements without altering the original array. <br>
        filter() checks all the element in an array to see if it meets a certain conditions and returns a new array with the elements that return truthy for the condition without altering the original array. <br>
        forEach() is used to execute the same code on all element in an array but does not change the array and it returns undefined. <br>
        find() is similar to filter but it returns only the first element that matches the condition.
