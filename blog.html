    <h1 >Question Answer</h1>
    <h3>1. What is the diffences between map, filter, foreach and find? </h3>
    <p >
        map() executes the same code on all the element of an array and returns a new array with the updated elements without altering the original array. <br>
        filter() checks all the element in an array to see if it meets a certain conditions and returns a new array with the elements that return truthy for the condition without altering the original array. <br>
        forEach() is used to execute the same code on all element in an array but does not change the array and it returns undefined. <br>
        find() is similar to filter but it returns only the first element that matches the condition.

    <h3>2. What is the diffences between local storage, session storage and cookies</h3>
    <p>
        Local storage, session storage and cookies are used to store data in the window. Main difference between local storage and session storage is session storage data is cleared when tab or browser is closed whereas local storage data remains in the browser even if window/ tab is closed. That is when we close the tab or browser session is expired and also session storage is expired but local storage data donot expire evenif session ended or browser is closed. Cookies are small text files used to store user information on the user's computer. Sessions are more secured compared to cookies, as they save data in encrypted form. Cookies are not secure, as data is stored in a text file, and if any unauthorized user gets access to our system, he can temper the data. Cookies help website remember information about your visit, which can both make it easier to visit the site again and make the site more useful to you.The storage capacity of local storage is 5MB-10MB whereas session storage capacity is 5MB.

    <h3>3. What is eventloop and How it work?</h3>
    <p>
        The event loop allows code to run asynchronously on the javascript engines. 
        Javascript is a single-threaded programming language that means it can do only one work at a time. When javascript run to execute command serially it maintain two things, stack and queue. Stack maintain the order in LIFO. For example, if we call a function inside another function then it will be maintain by stack. First it will execute the function that was call by another function, then the main function. When stack complete its task then it take new task from the queue. Queue maintain the instruction sequence also asynchronous task sequence. Queue maintain the order by FIFO. Javascript run this process in a loop which is own as eventloop.
